# Kalman Filter 

This is an example code for didactic purpose implemented while following [Prof. Shane Ross's Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/DbE4PMgqp3s?si=FHHlI85diNGjH8rQ) on Kalman filters.

This project is largely incomplete. Updates on new probabilistic robotic algorithms implemented using cpp will be included soon.


Improvement suggestions are appriciated (chukwukaokonkwo8(at)gmail(dot)com)

Feel free to use the code in your own projects..... Cheers ;
